## How to update CVAT

Before updating, please follow the [backup guide](/docs/for-developers/backup_guide/)
and backup all CVAT volumes.

To update CVAT, you should clone or download the new version of CVAT and rebuild the CVAT docker images as usual.

```sh
docker-compose build
```

and run containers:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Sometimes the update process takes a lot of time due to changes in the database schema and data.
You can check the current status with `docker logs cvat`.
Please do not terminate the migration and wait till the process is complete.

## Kibana app works, but no logs are displayed

Make sure there aren't error messages from Elasticsearch:

```sh
docker logs cvat_elasticsearch
```

If you see errors like this:

```sh
lood stage disk watermark [95%] exceeded on [uMg9WI30QIOJxxJNDiIPgQ][uMg9WI3][/usr/share/elasticsearch/data/nodes/0] free: 116.5gb[4%], all indices on this node will be marked read-only
```

You should free up disk space or change the threshold, to do so check: [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/disk-allocator.html).

## How to change default CVAT hostname or port

The best way to do that is to create docker-compose.override.yml and override the host and port settings here.

version: "3.3"

```yaml
services:
  cvat_proxy:
    environment:
      CVAT_HOST: example.com
    ports:
      - '80:80'
```

Please don't forget to include this file in docker-compose commands
using the `-f` option (in some cases it can be omitted).

## How to configure connected share folder on Windows

Follow the Docker manual and configure the directory that you want to use as a shared directory:

- [Docker toolbox manual](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/#optional-add-shared-directories)
- [Docker for windows (see FILE SHARING section)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#resources)

After that, it should be possible to use this directory as a CVAT share:

```yaml
version: '3.3'

services:
  cvat:
    volumes:
      - cvat_share:/home/django/share:ro

volumes:
  cvat_share:
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      device: /d/my_cvat_share
      o: bind
```

## How to make unassigned tasks not visible to all users

Set [reduce_task_visibility](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/settings/base.py#L424)
variable to `True`.

## Where are uploaded images/videos stored

The uploaded data is stored in the `cvat_data` docker volume:

```yml
volumes:
  - cvat_data:/home/django/data
```

## Where are annotations stored

Annotations are stored in the PostgreSQL database. The database files are stored in the `cvat_db` docker volume:

```yml
volumes:
  - cvat_db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

## How to mark job/task as completed

The status is set by the user in the [Info window](/docs/for-users/user-guide/top-panel/#info)
of the job annotation view.
There are three types of status: annotation, validation or completed.
The status of the job changes the progress bar of the task.

## How to install CVAT on Windows 10 Home

Follow this [guide](/docs/for-users/installation/#windows-10).

## I do not have the Analytics tab on the header section. How can I add analytics

You should build CVAT images with ['Analytics' component](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/tree/develop/components/analytics).

## How to upload annotations to an entire task from UI when there are multiple jobs in the task

You can upload annotation for a multi-job task from the Dasboard view or the Task view.
Uploading of annotation from the Annotation view only affects the current job.

## How to specify multiple hostnames for CVAT_HOST

```yaml
services:
  cvat_proxy:
    environment:
      CVAT_HOST: example1.com example2.com
```

## How to create a task with multiple jobs

Set the segment size when you create a new task, this option is available in the
[Advanced configuration](/docs/for-users/user-guide/creating_an_annotation_task/#advanced-configuration)
section.

## How to transfer CVAT to another machine

Follow the [backup/restore guide](/docs/for-developers/backup_guide/#how-to-backup-all-cvat-data).
