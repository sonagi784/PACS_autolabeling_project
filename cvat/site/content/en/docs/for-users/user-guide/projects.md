At CVAT, you can create a project containing tasks of the same type. All tasks related to the project will inherit a list of labels.

To create a project, go to the projects section by clicking on the `Projects` item in the top menu. 
On the projects page, you can see a list of projects, use a search, or create a new project by clicking `Create New Project`.
