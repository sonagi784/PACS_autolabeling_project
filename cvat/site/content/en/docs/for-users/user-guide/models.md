### Models

The Models page contains a list of deep learning (DL) models deployed for semi-automatic and automatic annotation.
To open the Models page, click the Models button on the navigation bar.
The list of models is presented in the form of a table. The parameters indicated for each model are the following:

- `Framework` the model is based on
- model `Name`
- model `Type`:
  - `detector` - used for automatic annotation (available in [detectors](/docs/for-users/user-guide/advanced/ai-tools/#detectors) and [automatic annotation](/docs/for-users/user-guide/advanced/automatic-annotation/))
  - `interactor` - used for semi-automatic shape annotation (available in [interactors](/docs/for-users/user-guide/advanced/ai-tools/#interactors))
  - `tracker` - used for semi-automatic track annotation (available in [trackers](/docs/for-users/user-guide/advanced/ai-tools/#trackers))
  - `reid` - used to combine individual objects into a track (available in [automatic annotation](/docs/for-users/user-guide/advanced/automatic-annotation/))
- `Description` - brief description of the model
- `Labels` - list of the supported labels (only for the models of the `detectors` type)
