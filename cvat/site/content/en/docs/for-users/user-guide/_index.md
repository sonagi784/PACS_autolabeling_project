Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is a web-based tool which helps to
annotate videos and images for Computer Vision algorithms. It was inspired
by [Vatic](http://carlvondrick.com/vatic/) free, online, interactive video
annotation tool. CVAT has many powerful features: _interpolation of bounding
boxes between key frames, automatic annotation using deep learning models,
shortcuts for most of critical actions, dashboard with a list of annotation
tasks, LDAP and basic authorization, etc..._ It was created for and used by
a professional data annotation team. UX and UI were optimized especially for
computer vision tasks developed by our team.
